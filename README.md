## Highlights
- HPRNet is a bottom-up, one-stage and hierarchical keypoint regression method for whole-body pose estimation.
- HPRNet has the best performance among bottom-up methods for all the whole-body parts. 
- HPRNet achieves SOTA performance for the face (*76.0* AP) and hand (*51.2* AP) keypoint estimation.
- Unlike two-stage methods, HPRNet predicts whole-body pose in a constant time independent of the number of people in an image.

- Results are presented without and with test time flip augmentation respectively.
- All models are trained on COCO-WholeBody `train2017` and evaluated on `val2017`.
- The models can be downloaded directly from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1yKxQVRxjicvDDM_p1-uKdAewRaSIaY4P).


## Installation


0. [Optional but recommended] create a new conda environment.

    ~~~
    conda create --name HPRNet python=3.7
    ~~~
    And activate the environment.

    ~~~
    conda activate HPRNet
    ~~~

1. Clone the repo:

    ~~~
    HPRNet_ROOT=/path/to/clone/HPRNet
    git clone https://github.com/nerminsamet/HPRNet $HPRNet_ROOT
    ~~~

2. Install PyTorch 1.4.0:

    ~~~
    conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
    ~~~

3. Install the requirements:

    ~~~
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~~~


5. First clone the [DCNv2 repository](https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2) into $HPRNet_ROOT/src/lib/models/networks. Then, compile DCNv2 (Deformable Convolutional Networks):

    ~~~
    cd $HPRNet_ROOT/src/lib/models/networks/DCNv2
    ./make.sh
    ~~~

## Dataset preparation

- Download the images (2017 Train, 2017 Val) from [coco website](http://cocodataset.org/#download).
- Download [train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1thErEToRbmM9uLNi1JXXfOsaS5VK2FXf/view) and [val](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6VgwKnj8DeyGXCvp1eYgNbRmw6jdfrb/view) annotation files.

## Evaluation and Training


- You could find all the evaluation and training scripts in the [experiments](./experiments) folder.
- For evaluation, please download the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yKxQVRxjicvDDM_p1-uKdAewRaSIaY4P?usp=sharing) you want to evaluate and put them in `HPRNet_ROOT/models/`.
- In the case that you don't have 4 GPUs, you can follow the [linear learning rate rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677) to adjust the learning rate.
- If the training is terminated before finishing, you can use the same command with `--resume` to resume training.
